# Production Database Schema Fix

## Issue
The production database (worksync-b.onrender.com) is using `owner_id` column in the events table, while the local development environment uses `created_by`. This causes 500 Internal Server Error when creating events in production.

## Root Cause
- Production database schema: `events.owner_id`
- Local database schema: `events.created_by`
- Code was updated to use `created_by` but production database wasn't migrated

## Solution Implemented
Added backward compatibility to handle both column names based on environment:

**Files Modified:**
- `src/models/Events.js` - All event database operations now use environment-specific column names
- `src/controllers/calendarController.js` - Calendar events query updated for compatibility

**Logic:**
```javascript
const userColumn = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'owner_id' : 'created_by';
```

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Deploy with Backward Compatibility (Recommended)
1. Deploy the current changes to production
2. The code will automatically use `owner_id` in production and `created_by` in local/development
3. This maintains compatibility without requiring database migrations

### Option 2: Migrate Production Database (Future)
If you want to standardize on `created_by` everywhere:
1. Run the migration script: `migrations/fix_events_owner_id_to_created_by.sql`
2. Update the code to always use `created_by`
3. Remove the environment-specific logic

## Verification
- ✅ Local development: Events API working (Status 200/201)
- ⏳ Production: Ready for deployment with backward compatibility
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Files Changed
- `src/models/Events.js`
- `src/controllers/calendarController.js`
- `migrations/fix_events_owner_id_to_created_by.sql` (for future use)

The fix ensures that events creation and retrieval work correctly in both development and production environments without requiring immediate database schema changes.
